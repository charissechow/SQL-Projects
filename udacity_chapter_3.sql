AGGREGATION

-- aggregators aggregate vertically (columns), whereas to calculate across rows you use simple arithmetic
  
-- NULL = blank; ex. if a POC was accidently deleted or left the company
  -- syntax: IS NULL or IS NOT NULL; do not use = NULL b/c NULL is not a value

COUNT -- to count # of rows in a table, can be use for non-numerical columns
ex. SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM accounts;
or SELECT COUNT(accounts.id)
    FROM accounts;
  -- can be used to identify if rows have NULL values (missing data)
ex. WHERE primary_poc IS NULL

SUM -- will treat NULLs as O
ex. 
SELECT SUM (standard_qty) 
       SUM (gloss_sty)
       SUM (poster _qty) 
FROM demo.orders

QUIZ (SUMS)
1.
SELECT SUM(poster_qty)
FROM orders;

3.
SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
FROM orders;

4.
(WRONG) SELECT SUM (standard_amt_usd), SUM (gloss_amt_usd) 
        FROM orders
(CORRECT) SELECT standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd AS total_standard_gloss
          FROM orders;
-- because it gives dollar amt for each order in a table

5.
SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_price_per_unit
FROM orders;
-- price varies from one order to the next, use ratio cross all sales made

MIN & MAX -- ignore NULlS (treat as 0s), can be used on non-numerical columns
-- can return lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value by alphabet (closest to A)
SELECT MIN (standard_qty), MIN (gloss_qty), MAX (standard_qty), MAX (gloss_qty)
FROM demo. orders

AVG -- what we would see on a regular basis
-- compare max to see if its an outliar
-- ONLY NUMERICAL, ignores NULLs -> no 0s in nominator or denominator
  -- if want to count NULLs as 0s, need to use SUM and COUNT

QUIZ (MIN,MAX,AVG)
1.
SELECT MIN(occurred_at)
FROM orders

2. 
SELECT occurred_at
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1

3. 
SELECT MAX(occurred_at)
FROM web_events

4.
SELECT occurred_at
FROM web_events
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1

5.
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) standard_qty_avg, AVG(gloss_qty) gloss_qty_avg, AVG(poster_qty) poster_qty_avg,
       AVG(standard_amt_usd) standard_amt_spent, AVG(gloss_amt_usd) gloss_amt_spent, AVG(poster_amt_usd) poster_amt_spent
FROM orders;

GROUP BY
-- aggregate data within subsets of data (like SORT in spreadsheet software)
-- any column in SELECT statement that is not within an affregator must be in GROUP BY clause
  -- ex. group for idff accounts, regions, or sales reps
-- goes in between "WHERE" and "ORDER"

QUIZ (GROUP BY)
  
1. Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Your solution should have the account name and the date of the order.
SELECT a.name, o.occurred_at
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1;

2. Find the total sales in usd for each account. You should include two columns - the total sales for each companys orders in usd and the company name.
SELECT a.name, SUM (o.total_amt_usd) total_sales
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name;
  
3. Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.
SELECT a.name, w.occurred_at, w.channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON w.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY w.occurred at DESC
LIMIT 1;
 Â   
4. Find the total number of times each type of channel from the web_events was used. Your final table should have two columns - the channel and the number of times the channel was used.
SELECT w.channel, COUNT(w.channel)
FROM web_events w
GROUP BY w. channel
  *OR*
  SELECT w.channel, COUNT(*)
  FROM web_events w
  GROUP BY w.channel
  
5. Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?
SELECT a.primary_poc
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
  
6. What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.
SELECT a.name, MIN(o.total_amt_usd) smallest_order
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.name, o.total_amt_usd
ORDER BY o.total_amt_usd
  *OR*
  SELECT a.name, MIN(total_amt_usd) smallest_order
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY a.name
  ORDER BY smallest_order;

7. Find the number of sales reps in each region. Your final table should have two columns - the region and the number of sales_reps. Order from fewest reps to most reps.
SELECT COUNT(s.region_id), r.name
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY s.region_id, r.name
ORDER BY COUNT(s.region_id)
  *OR*
  SELECT r.name, COUNT(*) num_reps
  FROM region r
  JOIN sales_reps s
  ON r.id = s.region_id
  GROUP BY r.name
  ORDER BY num_reps;

takeaways: 
-- only need GROUP BY for fields that are not in an aggregate
-- don't forget to name using ALIASes
-- you can use ALIASes with ORDER BY -- so instead of 'ORDER BY COUNT(region_id)' use 'ORDER BY num_reps'

GROUP BY PART II (GROUPING BY MULTIPLE COLLUMNS)
-- with ORDER BY, substitute numbers for column names in GROUP BY clause. only when grouping a lot of columns or if text is excessively long
-- all coluns not in aggregation must be in GROUP BY statement

QUIZ (GROUP BY OT II)

1. For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased for each of the paper types for each account.
SELECT a.name, AVG(standard_qty) mean_standard, AVG(gloss_qty) _mean_gloss, AVG(poster_qty) mean_poster
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.name;

2. For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on each paper type. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.

FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.name;

3. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
SELECT s.name, w.channel, COUNT(channel) count_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN web_events w
ON w.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY s.name, w.channel
ORDER BY count_channel DESC;

4. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON w.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY w.channel, r.name;
ORDER BY channel_count DESC;

DISTINCT 
-- used to retreive unique values from a specified/set of columns

1. Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.
SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id"
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id;

SELECT DISTINCT id, name

  ANSWER: NO
  
2. Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?
SELECT s.id sales_id, a.id accounts_id
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
  YIELDS 351 ROWS

SELECT DISTINCT id
FROM sales_reps
  YIELDS 50 ROWS

  ANSWER: YES

HAVING 
-- used to filter a query that has been aggregated (like WHERE clause)
-- WHERE is used before GROUP BY/ORDER BY
-- HAVING is used after GROUP BY and before ORDER BY

1. How many of the sales reps have more than 5 accounts that they manage?
SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(a.id) num_accounts

CASE STATEMENTS
-- "IF" "THEN" logic
-- always in SELECT clause before FROM
-- Starts with "CASE WHEN" , "THEN" , ends with "END AS"
-- "ELSE" = captures values not specified in the "WHEN THEN" statement
-- "WHEN" (like WHERE) can use same operators -> AND OR LIKE IN or > < >= <= =;

1. Write a query to display for each order, the account ID, total amount of the order, and the level of the order - âLargeâ or âSmallâ - depending on if the order is $3000 or more, or smaller than $3000.
SELECT a.id, o.total,
CASE WHEN o.total > 3000 THEN 'Large'
WHEN o.total < 3000 THEN 'Small' END AS order_size
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id;

2. Write a query to display the number of orders in each of three categories, based on the total number of items in each order. The three categories are: 'At Least 2000', 'Between 1000 and 2000' and 'Less than 1000'.
SELECT a.id, o.total,
CASE WHEN o.total >= 2000 THEN 'At least 2000'
WHEN o.total >= 1000 AND o.total < 2000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000'
WHEN o.total < 1000 THEN 'Less than 1000' END AS order_size
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY 2;

3. We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top level includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. The second level is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest level is anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.
SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd),
CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) >= 200000 THEN 'top level'
WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) BETWEEN 200000 AND 100000 THEN 'second level'
WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) < 100000 THEN 'lowest level' END AS order_amount
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.id, o.total_amt_usd
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

4. We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.
SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd),
CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top level'
WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) >= 10000 AND SUM(total_amt_usd) <= 20000 THEN 'second level'
WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) < 100000 THEN 'lowest level' END AS order_amount, o.occurred_at
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY a.name, o.total_amt_usd, o.occurred_at
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

5. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first in your final table.
SELECT s.name, SUM(total) total_orders,
CASE WHEN o.total > 200 THEN 'yes' END AS top_sales
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY s.name, top_sales
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

6. The previous didnt account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table. You might see a few upset sales people by this criteria!
SELECT s.name, SUM(total) total_orders, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_order_amount,
CASE WHEN o.total > 200 OR o.total_amt_usd > 750000 THEN 'top' 
WHEN o.total > 150 OR o.total_amt_usd > 500000 THEN 'middle'
ELSE 'low' END AS sales_category
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY s.name, sales_category
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
